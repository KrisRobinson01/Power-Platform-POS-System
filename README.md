# Power-Platform-POS-System
A point of sales system and management solution designed for restaurants. Users in a host role can assign a table to customers. If no tables are available then the customer’s information is taken, and their reservation is entered into a queue. When a table is available customers are notified in the order they are entered into the queue. Users in the Wait Staff role can use the app to input a customer’s order. The order is transferred to users is in the Kitchen Staff role who can access all the details of the order, notify the staff or customer about any modifications or substitutions to the order, and then notify staff of the order’s status. Once customers have paid for their order inside the app, they are given a digital receipt and a customer survey. A manager can use an app to see all of the orders, every table assignment, the wait list, and edit the menu. The menu should be available on a website and wait staff should be able to reference the menu from the canvas app while taking orders.
