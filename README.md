# Power-Platform-POS-System
A point of sales system and management solution designed for restaurants. Users in a host role can assign a table to customers. If no tables are available then the customer’s information is taken, and their reservation is entered into a queue. When a table is available customers are notified in the order they are entered into the queue. Users in the Wait Staff role can use the app to input a customer’s order. The order is transferred to users is in the Kitchen Staff role who can access all the details of the order, notify the staff or customer about any modifications or substitutions to the order, and then notify staff of the order’s status. Once customers have paid for their order inside the app, they are given a digital receipt and a customer survey. A manager can use an app to see all of the orders, every table assignment, the wait list, and edit the menu. The menu should be available on a website and wait staff should be able to reference the menu from the canvas app while taking orders.

Guidance on project presentation
You all can structure it however you would prefer, but someone or several people will need to cover your project plan and the initial set of requirements, how the teams were divided and organized, and layout any design decisions that you all made and think would be appropriate to place toward the beginning of the presentations, you'll need to demonstrate the finished product or as much of the finished product as you have been able to complete (and that would count towards the grade), and then walk us through kind of a recap of what team leads (or team members) believe worked really well or went right for what you planned, what y'all believe might have been a wrong approach or what didn't work, and what would you have done differently to end the presentation, run through how you thought it would go in the beginning, show what you made, then do a retrospective to talk about how it all went.
